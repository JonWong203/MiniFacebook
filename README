Instructions for building and running your project. The instructions must be sufficiently detailed for us to set up and run your application.

a. Setup AWS configurations
    Create Tables:
    adsorption → PK(S): “username”, SK(S): “url”
    article_to_user → PK(S) : “link”, SK(S): “username”
    interest_to_article → PK(S): “interest”, SK(N): “inxid”
    interest_to_user → PK(S): “interest”, SK(S): “username”
    interest_to_article → PK(S): “keyword”, SK(N): “newsID”
    messages → PK(N): “msg_id”
    news → PK(S): “link”
    posts → PK(N): “ID”
    rooms → PK(N): “room_id”
    users → PK(S): “username”
b. Run “npm install” inside of the root project directory
c. Run "node app.js" inside of the root project directory to launch the application
d. Click "Sign Up" and create a new user profile
e. Connect to your livy cluster
    If you are having issues with this and want to run the algorithm, you can do the following: 
    Go to ComputeRankLivy.java
    Delete all instances of livy and “client”
    Simply add: SocialRankJob sr = new SocialRankJob(); sr.initialize(); sr.run();
    Run ComputeRankLivy.java
